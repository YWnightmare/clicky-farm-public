# clicky-farm-public
Clicky farm is a godot based clicker game I created for my first godot project. Its probably a terrible, spaghetti coded, half finished project that is mainly just a learning ground. I have it here so anyone can look and modify it.

NOTE: THERE IS NO LICENSE. However, I am more than happy if you want to change something and make a fork of this repository. I might even add your feature if I like it enough! The only thing I ask is that you:
DO NOT release this for money
DO NOT copy this and use it as a game without my permission
DO NOT edit this without making a fork
DO go wild with whatever you want to do following the above rules!
Have fun and thanks for reading.
